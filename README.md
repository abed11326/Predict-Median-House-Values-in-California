# Predict-Median-House-Values-in-California
This project uses California census data to build a model of housing prices in the state. This data includes metrics such as the population, median income, and median housing price for each block group in California. The model should learn from this data and be able to predict the median housing price in any district, given all the other metrics.

This is the project in chapter 2 in the book "Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow ".
